# Lebanese Spicy Potatoes (Batata Harra)

8 medium gold potatoes - peeled and cut into cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 garlic cloves minced
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
1 cup chopped coriander
Lemon wedges for serving

Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

Place the potatoes on the baking sheet in one layer, drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top and season with salt. Roast until the potatoes reach a golden brown color and crisp, about 30 minutes, flipping halfway through.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small pan. Add the garlic, 1 teaspoon of the crushed red pepper and half the cilantro. Sauté until the garlic is golden in color, about 2 minutes; remove from heat and set aside.

Once the potatoes are roasted, transfer the garlic mixture on top of the potatoes and toss with the remaining cilantro and the red pepper flakes.

Serve hot or warm with a squeeze of lemon juice on top, if desired

Substitutes: For best results, follow the recipe as is. However you can switch out the herbs if you’d like, use butter instead of olive oil and make these with other types of potatoes. You can also reduce the spices based on your preference.

Hassan’s notes:
i don't use a recipe but its basically exactly what I do. However, this recipe uses an oven for the potatoes, I personally fry them cause they are crispier that way
i deep fry them, but air frying them should work perfectly fine
so i suggest you cut the potatoes into cubes, air fry them till crispy and then continue on with the recipe
