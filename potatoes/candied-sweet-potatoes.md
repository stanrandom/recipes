# Candied sweet potato

- 5g black sesame seeds
- 25g honey
- 50ml mayonnaise
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 spring onion



Chop your sweet potataoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces and add to a non-stick baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min or until starting to crisp. 

Trim and slice the spring onion finely. 

Combine your mayo with a pinch of salt and a small splash of your rice vinegar in a bowl - this is your Japanese-style mayo. 



Remove the tray from the oven and drizzle the remaining honey and black sesame seeds over the roasted sweet potato - this is your candied sweet potato. 

Return the tray to the oven for 8 min further or until they are caramelised. 

Drizzle the Japanese-style mayo over the sweet potato and garnish with the sliced spring onion. 

Enjoy!
