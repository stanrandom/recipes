# Candied sweet potato

Chop your sweet potataoes (skins on) into large, bite-sized pieces and add to a non-stick baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for an initial 25 min or until starting to crisp. 

Combine your mayo with a pinch of salt and a small splash of your rice vinegsr in a bowl - this is your Japanese-style mayo. 



Remofe the tray from the oven and drizzle the remaining honey and black sesame seeds over the roasted sweet potato - this is your candied sweet potato. 

Return the tray to the oven for 8 min further or until they are caramelised. 

Drizzle the Japanese-style mayo over the sweet potato and garnish with the sliced spring onion. 

Enjoy!
