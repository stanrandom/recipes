# Rosemary roast potatoes. 

Two potatoes each
2.5g fresh rosemary each

Preheat the oven to 220C/200C (fan)/gas 7 and boil a full kettle. 

Peel and chop the potatoes in half. 

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 10-12 minutes or until fork tender. 

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain them in a colander and shake them until theyâ€™re fluffy. 

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat. 

Once hot, add the rosemary with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant - this is your rosemary oil. 

Add the cooked potatoes to one side of a baking tray and drizzle over the rosemary oil. 

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min. 

Once they have been in for 15 min, turn them. Return the tray to the oven for a further 15 min or until the potatoes are crispy.
