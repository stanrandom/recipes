# Red rice

- 5.5g chicken stock mix. 
- 1tsp dried oregano. 
- 2tsp ground smoked paprika. 
- 16g tomato paste. 
- 130g white long grain rice. 

Heat a pot with a knob of butter over a medium-high heat. 

Once hot, add your tomato paste with half your dried oregano and half your ground smoked paprika and cook for 1 min or until fragrant. 

Once fragrant, add your white long grain rice and chicken stock mix with a pinch of salt. 

Give everything a good mix up until the rice is coated. 

Once the rice is fully coated, add 250ml cold water and bring to the boil. 

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 minutes or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked. 

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving - this is your red rice.
