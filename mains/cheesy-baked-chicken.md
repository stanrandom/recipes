# Cheesy baked chicken

- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 40g cheddar cheese
- 2 chicken breast portions 

Preheat the oven to 220C/200C (fan)/gas 7 then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air. 

Add the chicken breast portions to a chopping board and cover with a sheet of cling film. 

Bash the chicken breast portions with a rolling pin until evenly flattened and pat them dry with kitchen paper - these are your chicken escalopes. 

Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl, add the panko breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper. 

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up - this is your cheesy breadcrumb mix. 

Add the chicken escalopes to the bowl of cheesy breadcrumb mix and press then into the mix until nicely coated. 

Add the coated chicken to a baking paper-lined baking tray. 

Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)
