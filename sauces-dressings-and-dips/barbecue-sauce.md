# Barbecue sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped 
400g can chopped tomatoes 
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 
85g brown sugar 
3 tbsp malt vinegar
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
1 tbsp tomato purée

Heat oil in a saucepan and add the onion.

Cook over a gentle heat 4-5 mins, until softened. Add the remaining ingredients, season and mix.

Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 mins, until thickened.

For a smooth sauce, simply whizz the mixture in a food processor or with a hand blender for a few seconds.
